Demystifying Agentic AI: A Practical Guide with CrewAI
Ever wondered how AI "agents" actually work? They aren't magic—they're a clever orchestration of Large Language Models (LLMs), structured prompts, and well-defined tools.
I built a practical example: an automated IT Triage Crew. This system uses three specialized AI agents to process an incident ticket from start to finish.
1️⃣ Classifier Agent: Ingests a new ticket and categorizes it (e.g., Application, Infrastructure).
2️⃣ Analysis Agent: Assesses the ticket's severity (e.g., Critical, High).
3️⃣ Merge Agent: Combines all the data into a final, structured JSON report for stakeholders.
The architecture is built on a "chain of thought" process where each agent's output becomes the input for the next, ensuring a logical workflow. The real power comes from the custom tools I built—simple Python functions that provide the agents with reliable, deterministic capabilities.
This project was a deep dive into prompt engineering, model selection, and the art of designing an effective "crew." I've documented the entire process, from the initial (and failed!) experiments to the final working code.
